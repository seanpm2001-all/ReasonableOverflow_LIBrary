# ReasonableOverflow_LIBrary
Reasonable Overflow is a programming library that aims to prevent unreasonable numbers during an integer overflow, and maybe even stop integer overflows themselves. Written in many languages.

***

**Concept**

Library: reasonableOverflow
A library that:

* Phase 1: corrects displayed values of integer over/underflows so that they appear to be more reasonable/legal numbers (ie: a temperature overflow on a 64 bit system doesn’t go above absolute hot or (9+ bit systems) below absolute cold) written to work in many languages, including C++, Python, Fortran, Java, C, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, etc.

* Phase 2 (if scientifically possible, currently I don’t think it is): prevent all integer under/overflows
